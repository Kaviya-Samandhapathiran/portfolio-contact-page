**My First Portfolio Website - HTML & CSS**

This is my first personal portfolio website, built with HTML and CSS. It currently consists of two pages:

* Home: An introductory page that highlights my skills, experience, and projects.
* Contact: A simple contact form along with my contact details, allowing visitors to easily get in touch with me.
The project was created as a way to showcase my web development skills and to establish an online presence. It demonstrates my ability to design clean, responsive layouts using basic web technologies.
